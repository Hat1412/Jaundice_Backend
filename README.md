# üè• NethVera: Jaundice Detection Backend  
NethVera is an AI-powered system designed to non-invasively detect symptoms of jaundice using facial analysis. This repository contains the backend implementation of the Jaundice Detection module, developed using PyTorch for Deep Learning and deployed via Streamlit for a seamless user interface.

The system aims to enhance accessibility and early detection of jaundice, particularly in resource-limited settings. By leveraging a PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on culturally relevant datasets, NethVera offers a scalable and accurate solution tailored to the Indian population.
